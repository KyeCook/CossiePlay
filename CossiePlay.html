<h2>CossiePlay...</h2>
<p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Viennaville since 2011. We create outstanding custom-made costumes.
    <a href="Cosplay.html"><strong>Cosplayers</strong></a> can <a href="BuyCostumes.html"><strong>order</strong></a> any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced
    features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes
    take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.</p>
<p>We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.</p>

<h2>But What about the Parties?</h2>
<p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a <a href="Party.html"><strong>“CossiePlay Party”</strong></a> at the town hall. Entry is <strong>$15</strong> for adults, <strong>$10</strong> for
    ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are <strong>free</strong>. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at
    6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a <strong>live DJ</strong> at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common
    (but not required). </p>
